# Out-of-Band DNS Bind Server

A simple Bind9 server that acts as an open DNS resolver. 

**Note**â€”for this to work without specifying nameservers 
(i.e. `dig A +short foo.bar @ns1.foo.bar`), you would need your domain provider
to have the domain point to your custom domain for example:

- ns1.foo.bar => `127.127.127.127`
- ns2.foo.bar => `127.127.127.127`

## Usage

```
Usage: setup DOMAIN_NAME
       setup gbejna.bid
       setup -h
       setup --help

Options:
  -h, --help        Print this help message
```

You can then monitor your Bind9 traffic like so:

```
foo@vm13407021391238:~$ sudo tail -f /var/log/named/named.log

## Why

This is very useful when wanting to test for some very hairy vulnerabilities
such as XXE, SSRF and so on. You can inject payloads with random IDs and 
subdomains like `8273781123-xxe.foo.bar` and `grep` for it in your logs to
see if the payload ever executed.

This is also nice to do with Bind9 because:

- It's super fast, can handle being an open DNS resolver
- DNS outbound traffic is _rarely_ filtered, even if HTTP is
